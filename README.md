# Count your bits: more subtle similarity measures using larger radius count vectors
Code used to analyse and compare different molecular fingerprints.


## Preprint
This repository contains all code required to reproduce the results of the preprint ["Count your bits: more subtle similarity measures using larger radius count vectors"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.16.659994v2)
(will undergo more cleaning and documentation).

The used scripts can be found in the `notebooks` folder. In `src` we keep the central functions used throughout this project.
